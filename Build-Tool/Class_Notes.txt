	Prepared the Application Source Repository 
	
	
	
	- Automate Build the Source Code 		
			# Is a process of Compiling the Source Code and Creating Artifacts(Binaries/Executables - *.exec/*.dll/*.jar/*.war) 


	Java Springboot Web Application
	
		SRC_CODE Folder 
		
			*.java Programs 
			
				compile
				
				create the artifacts 
				
				perform Unit Testing 
				
				
	Environments :
	
		Non-Prod Environments														Production Environment (LIVE)
		
			Dev Environment	(VM)
				- Unit Test
			Build Environment (VM)
				- Unit Test
				
			Testing Environment (VM)
			
				- QA (VM) - Quality Assurance Testing 
				
				- UAT (VM) - User Acceptace Testing				==============>				Production Servers (VM)

	
	
	Build Tools :
	
		What is Maven Tool ?

			- Is an Java based Application Build Tool.
			- Using Maven, we can perform :
						- Code Compilation
						- Automate Unit Testing 
						- Create Artifacts 
						
		Build Tool :
		
			Maven/Gradle/Ant
			
			
		java compiler :
			
				javac 
				
	Dev Environment:	
		
		Developers' Workflow ::

			1. Create Program : *.java 
			
			2. Compile 
			
			3. Create artifacts 
			
			4. Test the program - Unit Testing using Unit Testing Tool like JUnit
			
			5. Push the Changes to Remote github repository 
			
			Tools required to perform these activities :::
			
			Tools :::
			
				- Eclipse based IDEs - like Eclipse for Java,Pycharm,Intellij, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code
				- Source Code Management Tool - like github/AWS Code Commit/Azure Repos 
				- Jdk, Maven, JUnit Testing Tool, git  
		

	Build Environment:

		Using DevOps Approach ::
		Automate ::

		- Identify/Clone the Source Code from Github Repository 		
		- Build the code - Compile and create artifacts 					
		- Unit Testing 			
		- Verify the Unit Test Coverage 
		- Archive the Artifacts in the Artifactory Library (Like Jfrog)
		- Promote the Application to higher testing Environment(QA)					
		- Notify the Testing/Development Team 	
		
		
	Source Code Repository 
	
		payment.java_v1.0(github)	-->  Unit Test 	--> payment.war_v1.0(Artifactory Library-jfrog) 
		payment.java_v1.1(github)	-->  Unit Test 	--> payment.war_v1.1(Artifactory Library-jfrog) 
		

	How to Perform Application Build, Unit Testing ?
	
		- Using Maven Build Tool 
			- Maven is Java Application Build Tool
			- Maven is used to Compile the Source Code 
			- Create Artifacts 
			- Perform Unit Testing
				(Unit Testing is a process of testing the changes done by the developers)
			- Maven can verify the Code Coverage 
			
			
		Application Build Process :
		
			Input 	: Source Code 	-	*.java  (github repositories)
			
			Output 	: Artifacts 	- 	*.war 	(Artifactory Libraries)
			
		Maven - Build Tool
		
		How Maven Works ??		
		
		Application Source Code Repository :
		
			Developer create POM.XML File to perform Maven Build
								
		Build Tools - Maven - used to build Java applications 
		
		Using Maven : 
			Application Build - Compile the code, create artifacts, perform unit-testing 


			Java Web Application Project : - 

			My_Web_App - Folder 
			
			Maven Project Structure :::			# Java Maven Desktop/Console/terminal Application;

			MVN_Project1				# Project Name 
				src 
					main			# Maintain the source code *.java - Business Logic 
						*.java
					test			# Maintain the Test Cases and Test Data - JUnit 
						*.java
				target
					artifacts *.war / *.jar
				pom.xml 			==> defines the application artifacts, plugins and all the required depedencies

				JRE_Libraries
				MVN_Libraries	


		Maven Project :
		
			pom.xml - Project Object Model :
			
				- Will be part of the Java Application Project - Source Code Repository
				- It is used to define the properties of application artifacts 
				- It is used to define dependencies and the plugins required to perform build/unit-testing
	
			Maven Repository :		https://mvnrepository.com/
			
				- Maven Repositories Contains the Maven Dependencies and Plugins 
				- During Build, Maven refer to this Repositories and Download the Dependencies to perform Application Build, Unit Testing etc...
				
				Eg.: 
				Build Environment (VM) :::

					Build the application	--> Jdk, Maven 
					
					Unit Testing - Junit Testing Tool 
	
			Maven Goals : 
				This defines the actions we perform using Maven 
			
				● mvn compile 	- to compile the source code
				● mvn test 		- to compile and execute junit test cases
				● mvn package 	- to compile, test and create artifacts in the target folder of Project Library
				● mvn clean 	- to clean the target folder.

				Eg.: 
				
				mvn clean package 
				
				
			Code Coverage :::
			
			JaCoCo	- Java Code Coverage 
				- Is used validate the Code Coverage :
				
					- 100% Code changes are covered during Unit Test.
